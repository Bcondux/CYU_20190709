Tensorflow Workshop in CYU
==
This workshop is for the beginners who would like to have the basic practice in Tensorflow (verion 1). The total training time is set to 4 hours.

# Agenda
The workshop will have 3 main topics, including:
1. Basic machine learning concept
2. Multi-layer perceptron
3. Convolutional neural networks

## Basic machine learning concept (estimated time: 40 mins)
This section will only give the basic concepts without coding. Since the basic machine learning concepts are still important when reading a paper or impletenting a new architecture of the models, this section aims to give the primer to the colleagues.

### basic concepts with the classic models
* Linear regression
* Logistic regression

### training concepts
* Overfitting and underfitting
* Dataset: training, test and validation (holdout validation, n-fold cross validation and leave-one-out cross validation)

## Multi-layer perceptron (estimated time: 120 mins)
Since the multilayer perceptron (MLP) include many operators of the tensor manipulating, creating MLP would be helpful to understand how the tensor works and how they flow in the neural network. This section will give the basic dataset (MNIST), the basic concept of tensor and the optimization of cross entropy. Finally, the overparameterization concept will also be given.
* The dataset – using the MNIST as example and numpy as example
* The tensors in numpy
* coding in Tensorflow – the computation graph (without the back propagation) 
* the concepts of gradient decent

## Convolutional neural network (estimated time: 80 mins)
Most the basic concepts are given in the previous section, this section will give the relations between the MLP and the convolutional neural network (CNN).
* How the CNN working
* Basic CNN operators (2D convolution and 2D pooling) 

## Additional Section: How to inference the data
This workshop aims to teach how to manipulate Tensorflow, but it is hard to tell everything in 4 hours. If we have enough, how to inference data will be also given.

# The requires of the audiences
Since the workshop aim to give the concepts of machine learning and implementing with Tensorflow, we won’t give any programing concepts. So, we hope you:
* Having **basic Python coding** technique
* Having basic linear algebra concept (not too much)
